Description
===========

Having trouble finding the answer to a LaTeX question -- or struggling
to find the words to express your question?  The Visual LaTeX FAQ is
an innovative new search interface that presents over a hundred
typeset samples of frequently requested document formatting.  Simply
click on a hyperlinked piece of text that matches what you want to
achieve -- or what you want to prevent -- and the Visual LaTeX FAQ
will send your Web browser to the appropriate page in the TeX FAQ.


Caveat
======

The Visual LaTeX FAQ makes extensive use of PDF hyperlinks to Web
pages.  Unfortunately, not every PDF viewer supports this type of
hyperlink and even those viewers that do may need to be configured to
launch a Web browser.  The troubleshoot-vlf.pdf document is intended
to help troubleshoot problems with hyperlinks in the Visual LaTeX FAQ.
Follow the instructions in that document to help determine why
hyperlinks aren't working on your system.
